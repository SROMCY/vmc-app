  <!-- Hand-crafted simple and robust alternative for contentFiles and lib paths not working as advertised
       in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/select-assemblies-referenced-by-projects.
       as opposed to contentFiles, this approach allows hiding the assets from the GUI.
       
       Place all files not used during compile-time in the build\runtime path instead of the lib path.
       
       You can use this script as top-level NuGet script by renaming it accordingly in the .nuspec.
